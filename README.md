Product Price Comparison
Currently, the project is about comparing FairLife milk price in Walmart, Supertstore and Save On Food. Generate prices in a csv file. 
This idea is from my Cybersecurity Bootcamp classmate, Cona. He wondered if we could use Python to compare a product's price in different stores. 
At that moment, I knew Selenium can scrape the price so I started this project. 
Later, I may replace the milk with an input product, and replace stores by input stores. 
The function is using a tool to compare price. The purpose, mostly, is to find the lowest price by comparison.
