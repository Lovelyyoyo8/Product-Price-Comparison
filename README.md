Product Price Comparison
The function is using a Selenium to compare price. The purpose, mostly, is to find the lowest price by comparison.
In the beginning, the project was about comparing FairLife milk price in Walmart, Supertstore and Save On Food. Generated prices in a csv file. 
This idea was from my Cybersecurity Bootcamp classmate, Cona. He wondered if we could use Python to compare a product's price in different stores.
At that moment, I knew Selenium can scrape the price so I started this project. 
Now, I replaced the milk with an input product.
I tried replacing stores by input stores, but it's harder which may need to search for the store first and not sure if the store's website can be searched.
